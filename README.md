# FINOS DTCC Hackathon 


## Project Name
SentiNova 

### Project Details
Sentinova leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to analyze market sentiment from various text sources (news articles, social media, financial reports). The goal is to detect trends, forecast market movements, and Predict market trends based on sentiment fluctuations. Provide visual insights & reports for decision-makers.

**ML Model Overview:**
This model is designed to predict the opening and closing prices of stocks using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and an Attention mechanism. The model leverages historical stock prices along with sentiment analysis scores to enhance prediction accuracy. There are two models which are taken into consideration for comparison of the model's performance.

The following are the models considered for comparison:

Model 1:  Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks + Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) followed by ensemble regressor (Random forest regressor)
Model 2: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) + Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks + Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) + Attention mechanism

## Using DCO to sign your commits

**All commits** must be signed with a DCO signature to avoid being flagged by the DCO Bot. This means that your commit log message must contain a line that looks like the following one, with your actual name and email address:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

Adding the `-s` flag to your `git commit` will add that line automatically. You can also add it manually as part of your commit log message or add it afterwards with `git commit --amend -s`.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information
